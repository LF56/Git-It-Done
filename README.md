# Description
This week, we were tasked to create an application called `Git-It-Done`. This is an application to search Git users and their projects. You are able to refine the topica by languages such as `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. To take it a step further, you can also see which projects have open and closed issues, so you can determine if you would like to contribute or not. 

# Install
You can either choose to clone the repositiory and save it on your device, or you can access the deployed site using the link in the Deployed Site section of this ReadMe.

# Usage
Use this application to find open source projects. This will help you learn how to contribute on Github to other projects.
